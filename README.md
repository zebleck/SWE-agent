## üëã Overview <a name="overview"></a>
SWE-agent turns LMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents that can fix bugs and issues in real GitHub repositories.

On [SWE-bench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench), SWE-agent resolves **12.29%** of issues, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on the full test set.

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University.

### ‚ú® Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) <a name="aci"></a>
We accomplish these results by designing simple LM-centric commands and feedback formats to make it easier for the LM to browse the repository, view, edit and execute code files. We call this an **Agent-Computer Interface** (ACI) and build the SWE-agent repository to make it easy to iterate on ACI design for repository-level coding agents.

Just like how typical language models requires good prompt engineering, good ACI design leads to much better results when using agents. As we show in our paper, a baseline agent without a well-tuned ACI does much worse than SWE-agent.

SWE-agent contains features that we discovered to be immensely helpful during the agent-computer interface design process:
1. We add a linter that runs when an edit command is issued, and do not let the edit command go through if the code isn't syntactically correct.
2. We supply the agent with a special-built file viewer, instead of having it just ```cat``` files. We found that this file viewer works best when displaying just 100 lines in each turn. The file editor that we built has commands for scrolling up and down and for performing a search within the file.
3. We supply the agent with a special-built full-directory string searching command. We found that it was important for this tool to succintly list the matches- we simply list each file that had at least one match. Showing the model more context about each match proved to be too confusing for the model. 
4. When commands have an empty output we return a message saying "Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output."

Read our paper for more details [coming soon!].

## üöÄ Setup <a name="setup"></a>

### üèéÔ∏è Express Setup + Run

You can run the software directly using Docker. 

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), then start Docker locally.
2. Run `docker pull sweagent/swe-agent:latest`
3. Add your API tokens to a file `keys.cfg` as explained [below](#-add-your-api-keystokens)

Then run

```bash
# NOTE:
# This assumes that keys.cfg is in your current directory (else fix the path below)
# This command is equivalent to the script shown in the quickstart 
docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd)/keys.cfg:/app/keys.cfg \
  sweagent/swe-agent-run:latest \
  python run.py --image_name=sweagent/swe-agent:latest \
  --model_name gpt4 \
  --data_path https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/1603 \
  --config_file config/default_from_url.yaml  --skip_existing=False
```

> [!TIP]
> * For more information on the different API keys/tokens, see [below](#-add-your-api-keystokens).
> * If you're using docker on Windows, use `-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
>   (double slash) to escape it ([more information](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47229180/)).
> * See the [installation issues section](#-installation-issues) for more help if you run into
>   trouble.

### More installation tips

If you seem to be having issues with running docker

* Make sure that you allow the use of the Docker socket. In Docker desktop, click *Settings* > *Advanced* > *Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password)*
* If your docker installation uses a different socket, you might have to symlink them, see [this command for example](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/issues/20#issuecomment-2047506005)

## üíΩ Benchmarking <a name="benchmarking"></a>

There are two steps to the SWE-agent pipeline. First SWE-agent takes an input GitHub issue and returns a pull request that attempts to fix it. We call that step *inference*. The second step (currently, only available for issues in the SWE-bench benchmark) is to *evaluate* the pull request to verify that it has indeed fixed the issue. 

> [!WARNING]
> At this moment, there are known issues with a small number of repositories that don't install properly for `arm64` / `aarch64` architecture computers. We're working on a fix, but if you'd like to run and evaluate on the entirety of SWE-bench, the easiest way is by using an `x86` machine.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Inference <a name="inference"></a>
**Inference on *any* GitHub Issue**: See [above](#-quickstart-solve-real-life-github-issues-).

**Inference on SWE-bench**: Run SWE-agent on [SWE-bench Lite](https://www.swebench.com/lite.html) and generate patches.
```bash
python run.py --model_name gpt4 \
  --per_instance_cost_limit 2.00 \
  --config_file ./config/default.yaml
```

If you'd like to run on a *single* issue from SWE-bench, use the `--instance_filter` option as follows:
```bash
python run.py --model_name gpt4 \
  --instance_filter marshmallow-code__marshmallow-1359
```

### üß™ Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>
This step is only available for issues from the SWE-bench set. To evaluate generated pull requests:
```bash
cd evaluation/
./run_eval.sh <predictions_path>
```
Replace `<predictions_path>` with the path to the model's predictions, which should be generated from the *Inference* step. The `<predictions_path>` arguments should look like `../trajectories/<username>/<model>-<dataset>-<hyperparams>/all_preds.jsonl`
* See the [`evaluation/`](evaluation/) folder for details about how evaluation works.
